I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at [Sungkyunkwan University]({% post_url https://gbme.skku.edu/gbme/index.do %}) and [Center for Neuroscience Imaging Research]({% post_url https://centers.ibs.re.kr/html/cnir_en/ %}). My Ph.D. advisor is Dr. Choong-Wan Woo, who has been directing the [Computational Cognitive Affective Neuroscience Lab](% post_url https://cocoanlab.github.io/ %}). My research interest is lie in understanding the brain mechanisms of how pain and pleasure interact in the cognitive and affective dimensions, and how this extends to systems-level understanding of how the brain process the general human emotion and cognition.
