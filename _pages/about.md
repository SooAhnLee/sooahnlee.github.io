I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Sungkyunkwan University and Center for Neuroscience Imaging Research (https://centers.ibs.re.kr/html/cnir_en/) in South Korea. My Ph.D. advisor is Dr. Choong-Wan Woo, who has been directing the Computational Cognitive Affective Neuroscience Lab (https://cocoanlab.github.io/). My research interest is lie in understanding the brain mechanisms of how pain and pleasure interact in the cognitive and affective dimensions, and how this extends to systems-level understanding of how the brain process the general human emotion and cognition.
