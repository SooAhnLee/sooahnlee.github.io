title: "Brain representations of affective valence and intensity in sustained pleasure and pain"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/PNAS2024
excerpt: 'This paper is about finding shared brain representations across sustained pleasure and pain, which we termed as the "affective valence" and "affective intensity". These are the affective dimensions encoding common emotional information across sustained pleasure and pain. The affective valence represents a positive-to-negative scale, and the affective intensity represents a weak-to-strong scale. These two dimensions were encoded in distinctive spatial patterns of activations across the brain regions that responded to both sustained pleasure and pain.'
